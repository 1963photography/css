      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="hello"> I'm a photographer, and I really like taking pictures of homes. I'm kind of a geek about it and I take it personally if I can't get an epic picture of a home I'm working with. These are the things that keep me up at night,
        lol. Oh, and coffee...</p>

      <h2>My Skills:</h2>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="left-skill" src="camera-generic.png" alt="generic camera - image">
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I have extensive experience using the Canon EOS system to shoot architecture and have trained many photographers on this system as well. My current camera platforms are the Sony Alpha series of full frame image sensor cameras and the Fuji X series of crop sensor cameras.</p>

        <img class="right-skill" src="studio-light.png" alt="studio light - image">
        <h3>Lighting</h3>
        <p>Some of the best lighting techniques are all about situational awareness and using good timing to make the best use of natural lighting. I also really enjoy the art of supplemental lighting and have honed my skills to blend supplemental lighting with natural light to highlight or reveal special architectural features.  </p>

        <h3>Editing</h3>
        <p> Computers are the modern photographers darkroom, so we spend a fair ammount of time with them. My primary editing software consists of Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and Capture One.</p>

  <h3>Virtual Tours</h3>
  <p> Love it or hate it, the virtual world is only getting bigger. I've completed hundreds of awesome virtual tours with the Matterport system and used to be trainer for using it. I also use a Nodal Nija camera rotator for ultra high resolution virtual environment creation.</p>

  <h3>Aerial Photography</h3>
  <p> I use a DJI drone for capturing an overhead perspective. It's very useful for showing how a home relates to its surroundings.</p>

      <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
      <h3>I love to making homes look great.</h3>
      <p>If you like architecture and you're into adventures as much as I am, you can hire me to take pictures of your home. </p>
